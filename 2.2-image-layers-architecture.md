# ðŸ“Œ Understanding Image Layers and Layer-based Architecture.
When a Docker image is built, it becomes a finalized, unchangeable entity. If you need to make updates, the image must be rebuilt from scratch. This process is central to Docker's use of layers.

## ðŸ”¹ What Are Image Layers?
Docker images are constructed from layers, with each layer representing an instruction in the Dockerfile. When an image is rebuilt, only the layers where changes have been detected are re-evaluated, along with all subsequent layers. This layer-based approach significantly speeds up the rebuilding process, especially when the changes are minor.

## ðŸ”¹ Layer-Based Architecture in Docker
Docker employs a caching mechanism during the image-building process. Each instruction in the Dockerfile creates a layer, and Docker caches the results of these layers. When you rebuild an image, Docker reuses the cached layers for instructions that havenâ€™t changed, avoiding unnecessary reprocessing. This optimization makes the build process more efficient.

- **Layers and Caching:** Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer. These layers are cached, and unchanged layers are not rebuilt during re-builds of the same image.
- **Immutability of Images:** Once an image is built, it is immutable; any code changes require the image to be rebuilt.
