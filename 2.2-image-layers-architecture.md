# ðŸ“Œ Understanding Image Layers and Layer-based Architecture.
When a Docker image is built, it becomes a finalized, unchangeable entity. If you need to make updates, the image must be rebuilt from scratch. This process is central to Docker's use of layers.

## ðŸ”¹ What Are Image Layers?
Docker images are constructed from layers, with each layer representing an instruction in the Dockerfile. When an image is rebuilt, only the layers where changes have been detected are re-evaluated, along with all subsequent layers. This layer-based approach significantly speeds up the rebuilding process, especially when the changes are minor.

## ðŸ”¹ Layer-Based Architecture in Docker
Docker employs a caching mechanism during the image-building process. Each instruction in the Dockerfile creates a layer, and Docker caches the results of these layers. When you rebuild an image, Docker reuses the cached layers for instructions that havenâ€™t changed, avoiding unnecessary reprocessing. This optimization makes the build process more efficient.

- **Layers and Caching:** Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer. These layers are cached, and unchanged layers are not rebuilt during re-builds of the same image.
- **Immutability of Images:** Once an image is built, it is immutable; any code changes require the image to be rebuilt.

## ðŸ”¹ Rebuilding Images.
When you need to modify the content or behavior of an image, it must be rebuilt to apply those changes. In Docker, if any layer within the Dockerfile is altered, all subsequent layers must also be rebuilt. This is because Docker cannot determine if the final outcome will remain consistent after the change.
   
**Consider the following example dockerfile:**   
If you modify any files involved in the **`COPY . /app`** instruction, Docker will rebuild all subsequent layers, from **`COPY`** to **`CMD`**, all layers will be recalculated and re-cached.

```bash
FROM nodejs
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN npm install
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

## ðŸ”¹ Optimizing Dockerfile for Efficient Builds.
Dockerfiles can certainly be optimized by organizing the dockerfile instructions and perhaps using a more granular approach to it.
One way to optimize the previous example build process is by copying only the essential files before running **`npm install`**. 

>[!TIP]
>Optimizing dockerfile instructions allows you to make certain changes without triggering the rebuild of time-intensive layers.







## Container layer on images.
After an image is built, it can be used to create a container. Containers are read-write, meaning they can be modified during runtime, while images remain read-only.
