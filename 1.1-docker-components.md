# ðŸ“Œ Understanding Docker, Docker Engine and Docker Desktop.


## ðŸ”¹ Docker Engine.
Docker Engine is the core software that runs containers. It is the underlying platform responsible for managing and executing Docker containers. Docker Engine can run directly on Linux. It cannot run directly on Windows and macOS: in those cases it requires a Linux virtual machine.   
Docker Engine includes the following key components:

>[!NOTE]
> Docker Engine operates via the command line and does not include a GUI by default. However, a frontend can be configured separately after installation if needed.

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Docker Daemon:</strong> The background service that manages Docker objects (containers, images, networks, and volumes).</li>
        <li><strong>REST API:</strong> Serves as the communication interface between the Docker CLI and the Docker Daemon.</li>
        <li><strong>Docker CLI:</strong> The command-line interface to interact with Docker (e.g., docker run, docker build).</li>

Docker Engine is typically used on servers or in cloud environments where you want to run and manage containers. It's a core part of container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.



## ðŸ”¹ Docker Desktop.
Docker Desktop is an all-in-one Docker environment that includes Docker Engine, Docker CLI, Docker Compose, and other development tools bundled together in a user-friendly application, it includes a front end for easier management.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Docker Engine</strong>: Included as part of Docker Desktop.</li>
  <li><strong>Docker CLI</strong>: Command-line interface for interacting with Docker.</li>
  <li><strong>Docker Compose</strong>: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Kubernetes</strong>: An optional, single-node Kubernetes cluster for development and testing.</li>
  <li><strong>GUI</strong>: A graphical user interface for managing containers, images, and other Docker resources.</li>
</ol>

## ðŸ”¹ Main differences.
1. **Purpose:** Docker Engine is focused on running containers in production or server environments, while Docker Desktop is tailored for developers working on local machines.
2. **Components:** Docker Desktop includes Docker Engine but also adds a user-friendly GUI, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes, making it a comprehensive development toolkit.
3. **Platform:** Docker Engine is the core technology running on Linux or in virtual machines, whereas Docker Desktop includes everything in a self-contained application for Windows and macOS.
