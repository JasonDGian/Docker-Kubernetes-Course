# Docker Installation
Docker can be installed on **macOS**, **Windows**, and **Linux**, with each operating system having specific requirements that must be met before installation.

## Learning about system requirements.

Depending on your device's specifications, you will need to install either **Docker Desktop** or **Docker Toolbox**:   
- **Docker Desktop**: This is the 'standard' version for devices that meet the system requirements.
- **Docker Toolbox**: An alternative for devices that do not meet the requirements for Docker Desktop.

> [!CAUTION]
> For windows machines the installation is different depending on the OS version. **Windows Home** will have a different installation prodecure to **Windows Pro**. This is important because Home Edition will require WSL - Windows Subsistem Linux, while Proffesional Edition will only require Hyper-V.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hyper-V and Containers Windows features must be enable to install Docker Desktop on Windows.
> To enable Hyper-V on Windows follow this link. [Enable Hyper-V fast guide](https://github.com/JasonDGian/Docker-Kubernetes-Course/blob/main/enable-hyper-v.md)

On Linux the operating system natively supports containers and the associated technology.

For the installation follow the [official resources](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install) .  

## Confirm the success of the installation.
To check if Docker successfully installed, open a terminal within your system, no matter which one, and type `docker`. A list of possible command switches will appear on scren, otherwise, if you encounter an error message something must have gone wrong during the installation process.
