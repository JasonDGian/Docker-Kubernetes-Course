# What is Docker?
Docker is a technology that simplifies the creation and management of software development _containers_. 
   
## What is a _container_?
A container in Software development is a **standardized unit of software**. It is a package of `code + necessary dependencies`. This allows developers to distribute and employ '_ready to use_' applications and server-like utilities. 
   
> [!NOTE] 
> Support for Containers is built into modern operating systems and is a _must know_ tech for any aspiring developer.

## Why use containers?
When a software application requires a specific version of a dependency to run correctly, using containers helps the developer ensure that the application always uses the correct version of that dependency. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is crucial to have the exact same environment for development and production. This consistency ensures that the application will work exactly as it was tested when deployed in a real-world setting.
