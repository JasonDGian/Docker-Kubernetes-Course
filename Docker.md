# What is Docker?
Docker is a technology that simplifies the creation and management of software development _containers_. 
   
## What is a _container_?
A container in software development is a **standardized unit of software**. This unit packages code and all its necessary dependencies to run correctly. This allows developers to distribute and run 'ready to use' applications and server-like utilities.
   
> [!NOTE] 
> Support for Containers is built into modern operating systems and is a _must know_ tech for any aspiring developer.

## Why use containers?
When a software application requires a specific version of a dependency to run correctly, using containers helps the developer ensure that the application always uses the correct version of that dependency. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is crucial to have the exact same environment for development and production. This consistency ensures that the application will work exactly as it was tested when deployed in a real-world setting.


[!**Key takeaways**]
- Docker is a container management technology.
- Containers are standardized software units composed by [ `code` + `dependency` ].
- Using containers:
    - Eliminates dependency inconsistency problems and ensures the same environment for development and production .
    - Allow developers to distribute and run ready-to-use applications and server-like utilities.
