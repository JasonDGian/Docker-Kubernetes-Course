# ðŸ“Œ Docker Installation
Docker can be installed on **macOS**, **Windows**, and **Linux**, with each operating system having specific requirements that must be met before installation.

## ðŸ”¹ Learning about system requirements.
Depending on your device's specifications, you will need to install either **Docker Desktop** or **Docker Toolbox**:   
- **Docker Desktop**: This is the 'standard' version for devices that meet the system requirements.
- **Docker Toolbox**: An alternative for devices that do not meet the requirements for Docker Desktop.

>[!tip]
>To learn about Docker's requirements access the ![official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).

For windows machines, the installation is different depending on the OS version. **Windows Home** will have a different installation procedure compared to **Windows Pro**. This is important because Home Edition will require **WSL - Windows Subsistem Linux**, while Proffesional Edition will only require Hyper-V.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Hyper-V** and **Containers** features must be propperly enabled to install Docker Desktop on Windows.
> To enable Hyper-V on Windows follow this link. [Enable Hyper-V fast guide](https://github.com/JasonDGian/Docker-Kubernetes-Course/blob/main/1.2-enable-hyper-v.md)

      <td>   
         After assuring WSL and Hyper-V are enabled and functional we can procceed with the installation process through the installation wizard.   
        Download the relevant version of <strong>Docker Desktop</strong> from the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install">official website</a> and follow the steps.   
        Once the installation is finished, if needed, enable the automatic docker service startup.

The Linux operating system natively supports containers and the associated technology.
In linux, though, an important distinction must be made between **Docker Engine** and **Docker Desktop**.

For the installation follow the [official resources](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install) .  

## ðŸ”¹ Confirm the success of the installation.
To check if Docker successfully installed, open a terminal within your system, no matter which one, and type `docker`. A list of possible command switches will appear on scren, otherwise, if you encounter an error message something must have gone wrong during the installation process.
