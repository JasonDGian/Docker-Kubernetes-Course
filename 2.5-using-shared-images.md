# ðŸ“Œ Using Shared Images from Docker Hub
To work with Docker Hub images, whether your own or someone elseâ€™s, you can either pull the image manually or run it directly in a new container. Running an image will automatically pull it if it's not already available on your system.
The key distinction between the two actions lies in how they handle updates:
- **docker pull**: This command checks for the latest version of the image. If the image is already present locally, it updates the image to the latest version if necessary. If the image is not found, it will download the image and store it locally.

- **docker run**: This command does not verify if there is a newer version of the image. Once the image is found locally, it will create a container using the existing image, regardless of whether it's outdated or not.

## ðŸ”¹ Pulling Images from Docker Hub
To pull images (yours or othersâ€™) from Docker Hub, use the following command:
```bash
docker pull <username>/<repo-name>:<image-name>
```

**Example:**
```bash
docker pull jasondgian/djg-private-repo:customubuntu
```

> [!Important]
> When pulling images from a user's repository on Docker Hub, the repository must either be public, or you must have the appropriate authorization to access it.

ðŸ”¹ Docker Pull vs. Docker Run
- **Docker Pull:** Always checks for the latest image version before pulling or updating it locally.
- **Docker Run:** Bypasses any checks for updates, using the existing local image if available.
