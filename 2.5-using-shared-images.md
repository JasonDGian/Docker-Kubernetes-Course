# ðŸ“Œ Using Shared Images from Docker Hub
When using Docker Hub images, you can either pull the image manually or run it directly to create a new container.


> [!Important]
> When pulling images from a user's repository on Docker Hub, the repository must either be public, or you must have the appropriate authorization to access it.

## ðŸ”¹ Pulling Images from Docker Hub
To pull images (yours or othersâ€™) from Docker Hub, use the following command:
```bash
docker pull <username>/<repo-name>:<image-name>
```

**Example:**
```bash
docker pull jasondgian/djg-private-repo:customubuntu
```

This command downloads the specified image from the Docker Hub repository to your local machine. If the image already exists, it checks for any updates and pulls the latest version if necessary.

## ðŸ”¹ Running a Docker Image
To create a container and run an image, use the docker run command. If the image isn't already in your local system, Docker will automatically pull it.
```bash
docker run <username>/<repo-name>:<image-name>
```
   
**Example:**
```bash
docker run jasondgian/djg-private-repo:customubuntu
```

## ðŸ”¹ Docker Pull vs Docker Run
The key distinction between the two actions lies in how they handle updates:
- **docker pull**: This command checks for the latest version of the image. If the image is already present locally, it updates the image to the latest version if necessary. If the image is not found, it will download the image and store it locally.

- **docker run**: This command does not verify if there is a newer version of the image. Once the image is found locally, it will create a container using the existing image, regardless of whether it's outdated or not.
