# üìå Finding and Creating Docker Images

Most Docker images you use will be based on pre-built images from the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) registry. Docker Hub offers a wide range of images that you can pull and use without creating your own from scratch.

**Two Ways to Obtain Docker Images:**
1. **Pre-Built Images from Docker Hub:** Ready-to-use images that can be pulled directly from Docker Hub.
2. **Custom Images:** Modify existing images or build one from scratch to meet your specific needs.

## üîπ Using existing Docker Hub images

To create a container, you must specify an image name.    
If the required image isn't in your system's local image repository, Docker will automatically search for it on Docker Hub and pull it if found.
   
## üîπ Creating Custom Images
To meet specific application requirements, you can modify existing images from Docker Hub. This allows you to create tailored images that provide the exact functionality you need.

Custom images are created using a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile contains a set of instructions that Docker uses to build your image. 
While it's possible to build a Docker image from scratch, this would require including an operating system and other essential components, which is generally unnecessary. 

### Key Components of a Dockerfile:
- **Base Image:** The starting point for your custom image.
- **Working Directory:** The directory within the image where commands will be executed.
- **File Copies:** Files to be copied from your local system to the image.
- **Commands:** Instructions to be executed within the working directory.

### Dockerfile Example
```bash
FROM <base-image>

WORKDIR <working-directory>

COPY <source-path> <destination-path-in-image>

RUN <command-to-execute-during-build>

EXPOSE <port to expose> [ONLY INFORMATIVE, DOES NOT APPLY THE PORT EXPOSITION]

CMD [ "command-to-run", "argument" ] -> must be last command
```

**Example**
```bash
FROM node
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN npm install
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

> [!note]
> The RUN command is executed when the image is being built, while the CMD command is executed when a container based on that image is created.

Once the dockerfile is propperly done we must create the image

### ‚ñ´Ô∏è Process summary:

**1. Create the dockerfile.**
   ```bash
    - FROM <image>
    - WORKDIR <command workdir>
    - COPY <files>
    - RUN <commands to build the image>
    - EXPOSE <ports to expose>
    - CMD ["command-to-run-in-container", "argument-for-the-command"]
   ```

**2. Build the docker image.**
 - `docker build <path-to-dockerfile>`

**3. Create the docker container.**
- `docker run -p <host-port:container-port> <image-id>`
