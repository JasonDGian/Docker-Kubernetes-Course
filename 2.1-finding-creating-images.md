# üìå Finding and Creating Docker Images

Most Docker images you use will be based on pre-built images from the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) registry. Docker Hub offers a wide range of images that you can pull and use without creating your own from scratch.

**Two Ways to Obtain Docker Images:**
1. **Pre-Built Images from Docker Hub:** Ready-to-use images that can be pulled directly from Docker Hub.
2. **Custom Images:** Modify existing images or build one from scratch to meet your specific needs.

## üîπ Using existing Docker Hub images
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/131b7c4d-78f1-4077-b9d6-645998d69b62">   

To create a container, you must specify an image name.    
If the required image isn't in your system's local image repository, Docker will automatically search for it on Docker Hub and pull it if found.
   
## üîπ Creating Custom Images
To meet specific application requirements, you can modify existing images from Docker Hub. This allows you to create tailored images that provide the exact functionality you need.   
   
**Dockerfile**   
Custom images are created using a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile contains a set of instructions that Docker uses to build your image. 
While it's possible to build a Docker image from scratch, this would require including an operating system and other essential components, which is generally unnecessary. 

### Key Components of a Dockerfile:
- **Base Image:** The starting point for your custom image.
- **Working Directory:** The directory within the image where commands will be executed.
- **File Copies:** Files to be copied from your local system to the image.
- **Commands:** Instructions to be executed within the working directory.

### Dockerfile Example
Here is an example of Dockerfile syntax. For more instructions check this [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/). 
```bash
# Comment
FROM <base-image>

WORKDIR <working-directory>

COPY <source-path> <destination-path-in-image>

RUN <command-to-execute-during-build>

EXPOSE <port to expose> [ONLY INFORMATIVE, DOES NOT APPLY THE PORT EXPOSITION]

CMD [ "command-to-run", "argument" ] -> must be last command
```

**Example**
```bash
# Image based on a nodejs image.
FROM node
# Working directory set to /app
WORKDIR /app
# Copies all existing files in the dockerfile directory to the image /app directory.
COPY . /app
# Runs the nodejs installation command (with the copied files).
RUN npm install
# Informative section about the listening ports.
EXPOSE 80
# Default command that is run when a container is created using this image.
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The RUN command is executed when the image is being built, while the CMD command is the default command executed when a container based on that image is created.

Once the dockerfile is propperly done we must create the image

### ‚ñ´Ô∏è Process summary:

**1. Create the dockerfile.**
   ```bash
    - FROM <image>
    - WORKDIR <command workdir>
    - COPY <files>
    - RUN <commands to build the image>
    - EXPOSE <ports to expose>
    - CMD ["command-to-run-in-container", "argument-for-the-command"]
   ```

**2. Build the docker image.**
 - `docker build <options> <path-to-dockerfile>`

Running the command **`docker build --tag my-docker-image .`**

**3. Create the docker container.**
- `docker run -p <host-port:container-port> <image-id>`

>[!TIP]
>In the example the ports are exposed with **`-P`** which tells Docker to choose any working available port. To check in which port it is running you can open Docker Desktop and see the Ports section.
