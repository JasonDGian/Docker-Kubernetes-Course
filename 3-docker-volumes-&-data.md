# 📌 Understanding docker volumes and data.
When working with Docker, it's essential to understand the different types of data that can exist within a container. These can be categorized into three main types:
- **Fixed Data:** Static, read-only, lives in the image layer.
- **Temporary Data:** Dynamic, lost after container shutdown, stored in the container layer.
- **Persistent Data:** Retained after container shutdown, stored using volumes.
   
## 🔹 Fixed Data
This refers to the data stored in the image layer of Docker.

- It is read-only and does not change during the container's lifecycle.
- Fixed data often includes the base image and the layers created upon it.
- It is static and serves as the foundation for creating the container.
   
## 🔹 Temporary Data   
Temporary data is dynamic and created while the container is running.
- It resides in the container layer, which is writable.
- This data can include user input or variables generated by the application during its operation.
- Once the container is stopped or shut down, this data is lost as it is not stored outside the container.
   
## 🔹 Persistent Data   
Persistent data is also generated or modified during the container's operation, but unlike temporary data, it is retained even after the container is stopped.
- This data is stored outside the container using volumes or external databases/filesystems.
- Volumes and Bind mounts allow this data to be preserved across container restarts, making it ideal for scenarios where data continuity is necessary, such as database applications.

Understanding these distinctions is crucial for effectively managing data in Docker containers.

# 📌 Understanding Docker Volumes.

         <p>
Docker volumes are directories on your host machine's hard drive that are mounted into containers.<br/> They act as a "folder passthrough", allowing containers to read from and write to the host system. Unlike data stored directly inside a container, data in a volume persists even if the container is stopped, deleted, or restarted. This ensures that important data is not lost when the container lifecycle ends. <br/><br/> In other words, volumes provide a reliable way to manage persistent data in Docker, keeping it separate from the ephemeral nature of containers.

## 🔹 Creating volumes.
There are two types of volumes.
- Anonymous volumes
- Named volumes.

When the developer does not assign a name to a volume, docker will automatically assign a hash-name to it and this is what we know as 'anonymous' volumes. The big problem with anonymous volumes is that they will cease to exist as soon as the attached container is shut down. 


A volume can be specified in several ways.
- Specify a volume inside a Dockerfile.
- Specify a volume in the docker run command.
- 

### ▫️ Adding a volume via Dockerfile.
To add a volume in a Dockerfile, use the VOLUME instruction. This instruction accepts an array of paths, which specifies the directories inside the container that will be used to mount directories from the host system. However, this command only determines where the volume will be mounted within the container, not which host directories will be used for storage.

```bash
VOLUME ["container-mounting-point","container-mounting-point-2",...]
```

Anonymous volumes VS Named Volumes
- Anonymous volumes are deleted once the depending container is deleted - Named volumes are persistent.

To remove a volume 
```bash
docker volume rm VOLUME-NAME
```

To prune volumes.
```bash
docker volume prune
```
