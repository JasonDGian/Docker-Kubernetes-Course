# 📌 Sharing images & containers.
When sharing Docker images, there are two primary methods:
- Share the Dockerfile
- Share a Pre-built Image

## 🔹 Sharing via Dockerfile
Sharing a Dockerfile requires also sharing any additional files or source code the image relies on. For example, if you're sharing a customized Node.js image, you must provide the Dockerfile and the related files it copies or modifies in the image.   
**Advantages:**

- The recipient can inspect the Dockerfile and understand how the image is built.
- Allows for customization and adjustments before building the image.

## 🔹 Sharing Pre-built Images
Sharing a pre-built image means the recipient doesn’t need to build the image themselves, nor do you need to provide the source code. The image is ready to run as soon as it's pulled.

Advantages:

- No need for the recipient to rebuild the image.
- Faster sharing since no source code or build process is involved.

### ▫️ How to Share Pre-built Images
Pre-built images can be shared by pushing them to a public or private Docker registry, such as Docker Hub.   
To push an image to Docker Hub, use the following command:
```bash
docker push <image_name>
```
