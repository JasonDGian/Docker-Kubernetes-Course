# üìå Sharing images & containers.

When sharing Docker images, there are two primary methods:
- Share the Dockerfile
- Share a Pre-built Image
     

## üîπ Sharing via Dockerfile
Sharing a Dockerfile requires also sharing any additional files or source code the image relies on. For example, if you're sharing a customized Node.js image, you must provide the Dockerfile and the related files it copies or modifies in the image.   
**Advantages:**

- The recipient can inspect the Dockerfile and understand how the image is built.
- Allows for customization and adjustments before building the image.

## üîπ Sharing Pre-built Images.
Sharing a pre-built image means the recipient doesn‚Äôt need to build the image themselves, nor do you need to provide the source code. The image is ready to run as soon as it's pulled.

Advantages:

- No need for the recipient to rebuild the image.
- Faster sharing since no source code or build process is involved.

# üìç Share pre-built images through Docker-hub
Pre-built images can be shared by pushing them to a public or private Docker registry, such as Docker Hub.   

To push an image to Docker Hub you need to be signed-in and authorized.
To push to docker-hub use the following command:
```bash
docker push <image_name>
```

## üîπ How to push an image towards docker-hub.
1. Sign into docker hub through your browser.
   
2. Go to your profile and click on 'repositories'.
   
3. Create a new repository.

4. Select access type (private - public)   
**NOTE**: Public repositories allow access to everyone.

5. Take note of the push command.
This is how you push towards this specific repository.

6. Rename the target image with the repository name schema.   
   Docker, by default, is not "locally aware" of the remote repository. To solve this issue you must rename the image to be pushed with the following schema:       
   `<account-name>/<remote-repo-name>:<image_name>`   
   To do this you can either rebuild the image with the propper name or re-tag it.

7. Push the image towards the repository.   
   To push the image use the command:   
   `docker push <account-name>/<remote-repo-name>:<image_name>`

   After a while the image should load and be pushed.

## In case of autorhization error:
If you are receiving an authorization error you must
