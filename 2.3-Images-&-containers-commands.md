# 📌 Managing images and containers.
In all commands used here on, you can use the option `--help` to invoke the help center of the command in case you feel lost.

# 📍 Managing Containers
## 🔹 Listing and Inspecting Containers
List all containers (running and stopped):
```bash
docker ps -a
```

Fetch logs of a container:
```bash
docker logs <container_name_or_id>
```

Follow logs of a container (continuous output):
```bash
docker logs -f <container_name_or_id>
```

## 🔹 Creating and starting Containers
Create and run a container (attached mode by default):

```bash
docker run <options> <image-name>
```

Create a container in detached mode (background):
```bash
docker run -d <image-name>
```

Start a stopped container  (detached mode by default):
```bash
docker start <container_name_or_id>
```

Start a stopped container in attached mode:
```bash
docker start -a <container_name_or_id>
```

Automatically remove container when stopped:
```bash
docker run --rm <image-name>
```

## 🔹 Stopping, Removing, and Managing Containers
Stop a running container:
```bash
docker stop <container_name_or_id>
```

Remove a stopped container:
```bash
docker rm <container_name_or_id>
```

Remove multiple containers:
```bash
docker rm container1 container2 container3
```

## 🔹 Attaching and Detaching Containers
- **Attached Mode:** By default, `docker run` attaches the terminal to the container's output. The terminal will be "busy" and unable to accept new commands until the container stops or is detached.
- **Detached Mode:** Using the `-d` flag with docker run starts the container in the background. The terminal remains free for new commands. You can attach later with docker attach.
    
   
Attach to a running container's output:
```bash
docker attach <container_name_or_id>
```

Detach from an attached container (leaving it running): Use Ctrl + P followed by Ctrl + Q to detach the terminal from the container without stopping it.   
**Custom detach key sequence:**
```bash
docker run --detach-keys="ctrl-d" <image-name>
```

## 🔹 Interactive TTY and Input
Start a container with an interactive terminal (TTY):
```bash
docker run -it <image-name>
```

Start an existing container with an interactive terminal:
```bash
docker start -i <container_name_or_id>
```

# 📍 Managing Images
## 🔹 Listing, Inspecting, and Tagging Images
List all images:
```bash
docker images
```

Inspect the details of an image (layers, ports, OS, etc.):
```bash
docker image inspect <image_name>
```

Tag an image with a name and version:
```bash
docker build --tag <image_name:tag>
```

## 🔹 Removing and Pruning Images
Remove an image (only if no container is using it):
```bash
docker rmi <image_name_or_id>
```

Remove multiple images:
```bash
docker rmi img1 img2 img3
```

Prune unused images (cleanup):
```bash
docker image prune
```

## 🔹 Image Naming and Tagging
Naming containers and tagging images:
To tag an image, use the --tag or -t flag during image build:
```bash
docker build --tag myImage:0.9.1
```

To name a container when starting it, use the --name flag:
```bash
docker run --name <container_name> <image_name>
```

# 📍 Copying Files Between Host and Containers
## 🔹 Copying Files from Host to Container
Copy files from the host to a running container:
```bash
docker cp <host-source_path> <container_name>:<destination_path>
```

Example:
```bash
docker cp ./dummy.txt myContainer:/copied-files/dummy.txt
```

## 🔹 Copying Files from Container to Host
Copy files from a running container to the host:
```bash
docker cp <container_name>:<source_path> <host_destiny_path>
```

# 📍 Key Points on Container Lifecycle
- **Changes to Images:** If you make changes to an image, restarting an existing container does not apply those changes. You need to remove the old container and create a new one to apply the updated image.
- **Interactive TTY (Terminal):** You can create or start a container with an input terminal using -i and -t flags (or combined -it). This provides an interactive shell interface inside the container.
